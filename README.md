# Master-thesis-SEIR-model
Code solving the SEIR-model developed for our master thesis.
A big part of the thesis was developing and coding a SEIR-model of a pandemic, here: the Covid-19-pandemic.


The thesis was a partial collaboration between Maria M. Jacobsen and Eirik V. Stokke.
Work done on developing and analyzing the model was a complete collaboration. 


Got insight into coding differential equations in python thanks to an instructional video on youtube by vastevenson:
